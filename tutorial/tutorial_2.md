Got it! Let's move on to our second tutorial, building upon what you've learned so far.

**Tutorial 2: Putting it Together - A Basic Autoencoder**

Now that you understand linear layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers, let's combine these concepts to build a basic autoencoder.

**What is an Autoencoder?**

An autoencoder is a type of neural network that learns to copy its input to its output. It does this by learning a compressed representation of the input, called the "latent space." An autoencoder has two main parts:

-   **Encoder:** Compresses the input into the latent space.
-   **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original input from the latent space representation.

**Why is this relevant to our project?**

Our `SparseAutoencoder` is a specific type of autoencoder. Understanding the basics of a regular autoencoder will make it easier to grasp the concept of sparsity later. The encoder in our project aims to create a concept-rich, lower-dimensional representation of the text embeddings, and the decoder tries to reconstruct the original embeddings from this compressed representation.

**Let's build a simple autoencoder in a new file named `basic_autoencoder.py`:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

class BasicAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, encoding_dim):
        super().__init__()
        # Encoder
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, encoding_dim)
        )
        # Decoder
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(encoding_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, input_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        encoded = self.encoder(x)
        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
        return decoded

# Example Usage and Training
input_dimension = 784  # Let's imagine we're working with flattened images of size 28x28
encoding_dimension = 32

# Create the autoencoder
autoencoder = BasicAutoencoder(input_dimension, encoding_dimension)

# Dummy data (replace with your actual data later)
X_train = torch.randn(1000, input_dimension)

# Create a DataLoader for batching
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, X_train) # Input and target are the same for autoencoders
batch_size = 64
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

# Loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(autoencoder.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_idx, (data, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
        # Forward pass
        outputs = autoencoder(data)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

        # Backward and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

print("Finished Training")
```

**Explanation:**

-   **`BasicAutoencoder` Class:**
    -   Takes `input_dim` and `encoding_dim` as input.
    -   The `encoder` uses linear layers and ReLU to compress the input.
    -   The `decoder` mirrors the encoder's structure to reconstruct the input.
    -   The `forward` method passes the input through the encoder and then the decoder. Note that we only return the `decoded` output here, as the goal is reconstruction.
-   **Example Usage and Training:**
    -   We define the `input_dimension` and the desired `encoding_dimension`.
    -   We create an instance of the `BasicAutoencoder`.
    -   We generate dummy input data `X_train`.
    -   We create a `TensorDataset` and `DataLoader`. The `TensorDataset` wraps our training data, and the `DataLoader` helps us iterate through the data in batches. For autoencoders, the input and target are the same because the goal is to reconstruct the input.
    -   We choose `nn.MSELoss` as the loss function (suitable for reconstruction tasks) and `optim.Adam` as the optimizer.
    -   We implement a basic training loop that iterates through epochs and batches, performs the forward pass, calculates the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the optimizer.

**Exercise 3: Building and Training Your Own Autoencoder**

**To Do:**

1. **Create the `basic_autoencoder.py` file and copy the code above.**
2. **Run `basic_autoencoder.py`:** `python basic_autoencoder.py`
    - Observe the loss decreasing over the epochs. This indicates that the autoencoder is learning to reconstruct the input.
3. **Modify the `BasicAutoencoder`:**
    - Add more layers to both the encoder and the decoder. For example, add another `nn.Linear` layer and `nn.ReLU` in both. Experiment with the number of neurons in these layers.
    - Change the activation functions to `nn.Tanh()` in both the encoder and the decoder. Run the script again. Does the loss converge differently?
    - Experiment with the `encoding_dimension`. Try a smaller value (e.g., 16) and a larger value (e.g., 64). How does this affect the reconstruction loss? What do you think is happening when the encoding dimension is very small?
4. **(Challenge)** Try to visualize the original input and the reconstructed output after training. If the input was an image (you can create dummy image data), you could plot the original and reconstructed images to see how well the autoencoder is performing.

**This exercise will help you understand:**

-   How to build a complete autoencoder model in PyTorch.
-   The training loop for an autoencoder.
-   The impact of the latent space dimension on the reconstruction quality.

**Connecting Back to Our Project:**

Remember, our `SparseAutoencoder` in the project will have a similar structure to this `BasicAutoencoder`, but with the addition of a sparsity constraint. The core idea of encoding the input into a lower-dimensional representation and then decoding it back remains the same.

**Our Next Concept: Sparsity**

Now that you have a good grasp of basic autoencoders, let's introduce the concept of sparsity, which is central to our project's `SparseAutoencoder`.

**What is Sparsity?**

In the context of neural networks, sparsity refers to the idea that only a small number of neurons or activations should be "active" at any given time. In our `SparseAutoencoder`, we want the latent representation to be sparse, meaning that most of the values in the encoded vector are close to zero.

**Why is sparsity important for our project?**

-   **Feature Learning:** Sparsity encourages the autoencoder to learn meaningful and distinct features in the data. Each dimension in the latent space is forced to represent a specific concept or feature.
-   **Robustness:** Sparse representations can be more robust to noise and variations in the input data.
-   **Interpretability:** A sparse latent space can be easier to interpret, as only a few dimensions are active for a given input. This aligns with our goal of creating a "concept-rich" latent space.

**How do we achieve sparsity?**

We typically achieve sparsity by adding a **sparsity penalty** to the loss function. This penalty discourages the activations in the latent space from being too large. In our `models/sparse_ae.py`, we use **L1 regularization** for this purpose.

**Let's revisit the `models/sparse_ae.py` code:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SparseAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, encoding_dim, sparsity_level=0.05):
        super().__init__()
        # Encoder layers
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 2 * encoding_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(2 * encoding_dim, encoding_dim),
            nn.Sigmoid() # Sigmoid to keep activations between 0 and 1 for easier sparsity control
        )
        # Decoder layers
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(encoding_dim, 2 * encoding_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(2 * encoding_dim, input_dim)
        )
        self.sparsity_level = sparsity_level

    def forward(self, x):
        encoded = self.encoder(x)
        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
        return decoded, encoded

def l1_sparsity(encoded, target_sparsity):
    """Calculates the L1 sparsity penalty."""
    return torch.mean(torch.abs(encoded))
```

-   **`sparsity_level`:** This parameter in the `__init__` method represents the desired average activation of the neurons in the latent space.
-   **`nn.Sigmoid()` in the Encoder:** The Sigmoid activation function in the encoder's last layer helps keep the activations between 0 and 1, which can make sparsity control easier.
-   **`l1_sparsity` function:** This function calculates the L1 norm of the encoded activations. The L1 norm is the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the tensor. By adding this to our reconstruction loss during training, we penalize large activations, encouraging sparsity.

**Your Fourth To Do:**

1. **Create a new file named `sparse_training_example.py`.**
2. **Copy the `SparseAutoencoder` class from `models/sparse_ae.py` into `sparse_training_example.py`.**
3. **Add the following training loop to `sparse_training_example.py`:**

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.optim as optim
    from sparse_training_example import SparseAutoencoder # Assuming you saved the SparseAutoencoder here
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

    # Hyperparameters
    input_dimension = 784
    encoding_dimension = 32
    sparsity_strength = 0.001
    batch_size = 64
    learning_rate = 0.001
    num_epochs = 10

    # Create the sparse autoencoder
    sparse_ae = SparseAutoencoder(input_dimension, encoding_dimension)

    # Dummy data
    X_train = torch.randn(1000, input_dimension)
    train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, X_train)
    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

    # Loss function and optimizer
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(sparse_ae.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for batch_idx, (data, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
            # Forward pass
            decoded, encoded = sparse_ae(data)
            reconstruction_loss = criterion(decoded, targets)
            sparsity_loss = l1_sparsity(encoded, sparse_ae.sparsity_level) # Calculate sparsity loss
            loss = reconstruction_loss + sparsity_strength * sparsity_loss # Combine losses

            # Backward and optimize
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

        print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}, Reconstruction Loss: {reconstruction_loss.item():.4f}, Sparsity Loss: {sparsity_loss.item():.4f}")

    print("Finished Training")
    ```

4. **Run `sparse_training_example.py`:** `python sparse_training_example.py`

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Observe the Losses:** Notice that now you have both a "Reconstruction Loss" and a "Sparsity Loss." The total loss is the sum of these two (weighted by `sparsity_strength`).
2. **Experiment with `sparsity_strength`:**
    - Try increasing the `sparsity_strength` (e.g., to `0.1` or `1.0`). What happens to the sparsity loss? What happens to the reconstruction loss? Why?
    - Try decreasing the `sparsity_strength` (e.g., to `0.0001`). How does this affect the losses?
3. **Inspect the Latent Space:** After training, add code to inspect the `encoded` representation. Calculate the average activation (average of the absolute values) for a batch of encoded vectors. How does the `sparsity_strength` affect the average activation? Does it get closer to the `sparsity_level` defined in the `SparseAutoencoder`?

**This exercise will help you understand:**

-   How sparsity is enforced through a penalty term in the loss function.
-   The trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and sparsity.
-   How to control the sparsity of the latent space.
